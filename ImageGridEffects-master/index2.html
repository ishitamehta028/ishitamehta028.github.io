									<p class="smaller">
									Orwell, through this allegory carefully delves into the political and social
									dilemma and the human psyche wrapped in a fiendishly clever satire.
									It's unassuming at the beginning, as if written for children but as you go deeper into the book,
									it turns out to be more complex with many layers to the story.<br>
									I loved how animals were used as a medium to critique the ideological concept of equality, 
									how the oppressees become the oppressors. It is a timeless read and anyone reading this, will
									also recognize how closely it matches our political landscape.

										Harry Potter will always have a special place in my heart.❤️ <br>
										I have read the entire series several times and watched the movies more times than I can count.
										Everytime I read this again, I fall a little more in love with the series and its many characters,
										the carefull crafted world by Rowling. Every single page is just bursting with life and the words completely envelop you
										taking you into a wildly complex, imaginative world that leaves you yearning for more.
										<br> Perhaps I'm highly biased in favor of these books, partly because I read them as a teen and 
										have become attached to them. I will never not recommend these books.

										Another book from my childhood that is close to my heart.<br>
										Charlie & the chocolate factory is an easy read, classic children's literature.
										Insanely bizarre and amazingly imaginative, Roald Dahl always knows how to create playful prose with eccentric misfits.
										<br>Although as an adult, re-reading it made me realize that it does have sinister undertones
										(the oompa-loompas being slaves brought in from an island in Africa?!).

										I've read the English translation to this Japanese novel. 
										We know who the murderer is by the end of the first chapter, so the mystery isn't whodunnit
										but rather how was it done, which makes it all the more exciting to read in my opinion.<br>
										Higashino is a shrewd writer and this
										piece of psychological thriller lets us contemplate about the murder right till the end, all the while
										subtly inducing the complexities of human psyche and challenging our moral compass.

									<p class="smaller">
										I cried so hard at the end of this book.<br>
										This is one of those incredibly slow, subtle books that are told in a series of anecdotes 
										and take about a couple of hundred pages to get interesting. But by page 300, you'll be completely 
										engrossed in it and will absolutely love it. <br>
										The narrator here is 'Death', an actual entity in this book. He foreshadows on various distinctive incidents that happen later in the book.
										Overall, this novel, set in the Holocaust era, is one of the most unique books I've read. 
										The plot is chaotically beautiful and although runs for about 600-700 pages, has compelling naration.

									This is a 26 prose-poetry fables book. Gibran talks about life and death,

									'The Prophet' combines faith and philosophy in a series of questions. Although I struggle with Poetry, and have to

										Honestly, the narration is boring, but then again so many classics are. The plot however, is not.<br>
										I guess everyone knows the story in broad strokes, Ebenezer Scrooge, a cold-hearted miser, who by the end of the novella
										embraces the Christmas spirit and rejoices in it.
										Infact, "Scrooge" has entered our vernacular to indicate a mean-spirited skinflint.
										<br> A simple morality tale with social criticisms centred around the redemption arc of Scrooge,
										it's actually amazing, the influence this classic has had on our culture.

										With Roald Dahl, you can never be sure where reality ends and fantasy begins. Anything he writes 
										is sure to be a highly entertaining read, which is supported with this piece. This is a story-within-a-story about
										Henry Sugar, who is able to see through objects and predict the future with the help of a book he stole.
										This is yet another book where the protagonist goes through a redemption arc.<br>
										It's a great piece of character development, and the ending especially is nice and emotive.

									<p class="smaller">
										Sinister, scandalous, and seductive.<br>
										Set in the backdrop of French aristocracy, this novel revolves around
										the complex moral ambiguities of seduction and revenge. 
										The writing style here is different and unique, this one is an epistolary novel 
										, which simply means written in the form of letters. It takes some time to get accustomed to it, but it pays off. 
										I loved the way the author captured the heart ache, rawness, and the
										 vulnerability of the seduced with the sinister, calculated, and dispassionate behaviours of the seducer.

									This is such a charming little book with illustrations and photographs throughout.<br>
									The book shows how we can find a little bit more happiness in our lives. There is nothing ground-breaking
									in the content itself, rather the how it's presented. 
									Wiking's uses an interesting mix of facts, case studies, real stories from his life and statistics to get his points across.
									I go back to this book whenever I'm feeling low and looking for some motivation. And always find myself with a little more
									Lykke (Danish for joy and happiness) after it.
